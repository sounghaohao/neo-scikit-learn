## Neo-SciKit-Learn

[Chinese Version](https://github.com/sounghaohao/neo-scikit-learn/README-Chinese.md)

scikit-learn is a great project. It implements plenty of machine learning algorithms 
such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, model selection and evaluation, data set transformations, and so on.
It has become not only a good learning material for machine learning beginners, 
but also a reference manual for experienced machine learning experts.

The current scikit-learn project is a behemoth. 
Its large amount of auxiliary code buries the main logic and hinders the learning of beginners.
To be specifical, the most important thing for beginners is to understand the logic of the algorithm.
However, out of the sake of robustness, the current scikit-learn project contains a large amount code oriented to performance and program exception, 
which impedes the understanding of machine learning algorithms.

In order to lower the threshold for beginners, I decide to slim down the 
current scikit-learn and extract the most important algorithm logic from it.
The remaining code does not consider exceptions, does not consider performance, and is only used for understanding and learning purposes.

Enjoy it !
